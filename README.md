# EEPROM Compression Techniques
Compress your Arduino EEPROM data by 33% - see https://www/youtube.com/RalphBacon video #93

Sometimes the simplest 'algorithm' (fancy word for a bit of maths) can yield results out of all proportion to expectations. This video investigates a simple mechanism to  cram more data into an EEPROM than has a right to be there - and it is EASY.

I've uploaded the fully documented sketch example which shows how to encode the data and then decode it back again and I urge you to give it a try - it just needs an Arduino of some sort to play about with it.
 
As a beneficial side effect we discuss the fact that you might already be using pointers in your code without even realising it and, yes, we use them (in passing) here too but we might not even realise that unless it were pointed out to us.
